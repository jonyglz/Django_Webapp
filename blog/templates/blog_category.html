<!-- On line 7, we have the post title, which is a hyperlink. The link is a Django link where we are pointing to the URL named blog_detail, which takes an integer as its argument and should correspond to the pk value of the post.

Underneath the title, we’ll display the created_on attribute of the post as well as its categories. On line 11, we use another for loop to loop over all the categories assigned to the post.

On line 17, we use a template filter slice to cut off the post body at 400 characters so that the blog index is more readable.

Once that’s in place, you should be able to access this page by visiting localhost:8000/blog:

Blog Index View

Next, create another HTML file blog/templates/blog_category.html where your blog_category template will live. This should be identical to blog_index.html, except with the category name inside the h1 tag instead of Blog Index: -->

{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block page_content %}
<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2">
    <h1>{{ category | title }}</h1>
    <hr>
    {% for post in posts %}
        <h2><a href="{% url 'blog_detail' post.pk%}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
        <small>
            {{ post.created_on.date }} |&nbsp;
            Categories:&nbsp;
            {% for category in post.categories.all %}
            <a href="{% url 'blog_category' category.name %}">
                {{ category.name }}
            </a>&nbsp;
            {% endfor %}
        </small>
        <p>{{ post.body | slice:":400" }}...</p>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endblock %}
<!-- Most of this template is identical to the previous template. The only difference is on line 4, where we use another Django template filter title. This applies titlecase to the string and makes words start with an uppercase character.

With that template finished, you’ll be able to access your category view. If you defined a category named python, you should be able to visit localhost:8000/blog/python and see all the posts with that category:
